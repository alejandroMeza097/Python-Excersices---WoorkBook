Exercise 23: Area of a Regular Polygon
(Solvedâ€”14 Lines)
A polygon is regular if its sides are all the same length and the angles between all of
the adjacent sides are equal. The area of a regular polygon can be computed using
the following formula, where s is the length of a side and n is the number of sides:
area = n * s^2  / (4 * Tan(PI/n))
Write a program that reads s and n from the user and then displays the area of a
regular polygon constructed from these values.
